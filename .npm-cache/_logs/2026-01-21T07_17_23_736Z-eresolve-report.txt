# npm resolution error report

While resolving: my-v0-project@0.1.0
Found: react@19.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"19.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0" from vaul@0.9.9
node_modules/vaul
  vaul@"^0.9.9" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
